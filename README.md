Welcome to my collection of practice notebooks and micro-projects, documenting my learning journey in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Generative AI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This repository is a set of my hands-on explorations, experiments, and mini-projects, each focused on a key concept or technique in modern data science and AI.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into topic-based folders, each containing Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate theory, practical implementation, and real-world datasets.
